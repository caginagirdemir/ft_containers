# C++ Iterators

Iterators are just like pointers used to access the container elements.

Important Points: 
- Iterators are used to traverse(çapraz kullanılabilir) from one element to another element, a process is known as iterating through the container.
- The main advantage of an iterator is to provide a common interface for all the containers type.
- Iterators make the algorithm independetn of the type of the container used.
- Iterators provide a generic approach to navigate through the elements of a container.
